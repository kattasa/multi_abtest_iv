## Data Generating Process
\begin{itemize}
\item Set $n_{per}$ -- the number of observations per treatment group
\item Assign each of our $N$ observations to $K$ treatment groups, each group with $n_{per}$ observations
\begin{itemize}
  \item For $i = 1, \ldots, N$
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Let $i_k$ represent unit $i$'s treatment group
    \item $U_{i} \sim \mathcal{N}(1, 25)$, the unobserved confounder
    \item $\begin{pmatrix} X_{i,1} \\ X_{i,2} \end{pmatrix} \sim \mathcal{MN}\left(\begin{pmatrix} \gamma_k + 5U_i \\ \gamma_k \end{pmatrix} , \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0.64 \\ 0.64 & 1 \end{pmatrix}\right)$, where $\gamma_k$ is a group-level fixed effect
    \item $Y_i = X_{i,1} + X_{i,2} + 5 \cdot U_i + \varepsilon_i, \varepsilon_i \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)$
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Suppose we have $P$ experiments, each with two treatment assignments (i.e., treated or control). Then, we would have $K = 2^P$ treatment groups. We assume that $\gamma_k$ is the number of experiments that a unit belongs to the treatment group for. In other words, being assigned to the treatment group for an additional experiment would increase $\mathbb{E}[X_{i,1}]$ and $\mathbb{E}[X_{i,2}]$ by 1. Suppose unit $i$ is treated in 10 experiments; then the fixed effect for unit $i$'s treatment group is 10: $\gamma_{i_k} = 10$. 

Additionally, $X_1$ is the endogeneous feature whose causal effect we are interested in. The treatment effect is $1$, i.e., a 1 unit increase in $X_1$ will cause a 1 unit increase in $Y$, in expectation.

## Experiments
We considered two different experimental setups: one in which we set $n_{per}$ and increase $K$ by increasing the number of experiments; and another in which we fix $K$ and increase $n_{per}$. We consider $n_{per} \in \{1000, 2000, \ldots, 10000\}$ and $K \in \{2^1, 2^2, , \ldots, 2^{10}\}$. For each combination of $n_{per}$ and $K$, we compare the results using the Instrumental Variables Cross Validation (IVCV) procedure and traditional Two Stage Least Squares (TSLS) using the squared error:
$$ SE = \left(\hat{\beta} - 1\right)^2. $$

## Results

Figures \ref{fig:tsls_bias} and \ref{fig:ivcv_bias} display the bias of the TSLS and IVCV procedure for varying observations per group, $n_{per}$, and number of experiments, $P$. Please note that even though there are only 10 experiments, $K = 2^{10} = 1024$, so there are 1024 different treatment groups. When $n_{per} = 10000$, there are $1024 \cdot 10000 = 10240000$ total observations. If either TSLS or IVCV are asymptotically unbiased, then we should see the squared error of the procedure's tending to 0.

Interestingly, the IVCV bias has a smaller range of 3.25 to 4.25, while the TSLS bias varies from $\approx 0$ to over 200. However, as $n_{per}$ and $K$ increase, the TSLS bias tends to 0, which cannot be said for the IVCV estimates: even when $n_{per} = 10000$ and $K = 2^{10} = 1024$, the IVCV estimate still has a bias around 4.
